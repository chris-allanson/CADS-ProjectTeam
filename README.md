Hello team mates - Chris, Sarah, Dan and Arjun. This is our first combined repository for our project for Introduction to Programming. Don't Break the Build. (~Arjun)


---21 October 2017---
Today's project began at 1:30pm and ended at 4:00pm
Team has decided to do a space invaders meets Bit-Trip-Runner to create a hybrid classic meets rhythm game
Project assignments will be done as follows (current stage):
- Chris and Arjun to do additional tutorials on Unity to come up to speed
- Dan to send Unity Links
- Sarah to create Google Drive
- Sarah to oversee artwork
- Arjun to document team tasks
- Team will create mood boards for the concept design
- Team will also begin using Agile as a management method (as far as possible to be applied)
- Team has decided to use / learn Unity for this project for Introduction to Programming
- Team is moving towards creating game functions, assets, variables and classes which Dan and Sarah will oversee
- Team will create a kanban board (Trello) which Arjun will oversee


---22 October 2017---
Trello has been setup for the Kanban board and scrum management system. All four team members / contributors have been signed up and provided with administration rights. Based on yesterday's project goals, the CADS team will meet again in this coming week to assess progress for each individually-assigned task. Yesterday we also made good progress in figuring out how to use GitHub Desktop as a collaborative tool, and equally importantly, to upload PNGs. Our first whiteboard assignee has been uploaded to this repo. We have also figured out how the desktop commits work and will be following this procedure for when we take screenshots of our Unity progress (including code that cannot be committed directly to this text editor). I have to say we are  a good team. Team members are teaching each other from their own domain expetise and collective team knowledge is growing quite rapidly. We are also managing our expectations and ambitions for what we can accomplish given the limited resources (in this case primarily time) we possess. (~Arjun)


Since we are going to build a game in Unity and use C# as our default programming language, the entire team needs to reach at least a basic level of understanding. Sarah and Dan are relatively well-versed in the language. Chris and I (Arjun) are continuing to learn C# from team discussions and shared online tutorials. For reference purposes I have placed a code snippet here that will provide the basis for basic understanding of the language:
/*---BEGIN CODE---*/
using System; //using is a directive that tells the compiler the program is using a namespace called system
using Systems.Collections.Generic;
using System.Ling;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace WelcomeGreeting {
class Program{
static void Main(string[] args){
Console.WriteLine("Welcome to Space Invaders Meets Bit Runner");
Console.Read();
}
}
}
/*---END CODE---*/
}
